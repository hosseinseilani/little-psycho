This is lightweight Linux with a KDE plasma-desktop, based on the Ubuntu mini 20.04 LTS and equipped kernel 5.10 LTS and 5.8.

Little-Psycho has a focus on destructive and stress testing of both software and hardware and also included the overclocking and health testing tools.  These tools and commands impose much stress on the system and measure the performance of the system.

As a system administrator, you can examine and monitor the status of your Linux systems when they are under stress of high load. In this guide, we shall look at some special and important tools for destroying and stress testing under your Linux systems.
Little-Psycho will stress test a computer system in various selectable ways. It was designed to exercise various physical subsystems of a computer, as well as the various operating system kernel interfaces.
# You can test your system for the following features:
* CPU compute
* Drive stress
* I/O syncs
* Pipe I/O
* Cache thrashing
* VM stress
* Socket stressing
* Process creation and termination
* Context switching properties
# Such as:
