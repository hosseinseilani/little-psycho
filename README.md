# Little-Psycho Linux
    # The more silent
          # The more dangerous

It is maintained and established in 2021 by Hossein Seilani, the developer of Emperor-os and predator-os Linux.  
This is lightweight Linux with a KDE plasma-desktop, based on the Ubuntu mini 20.04 LTS and equipped kernel 5.10 LTS and 5.8.

Little-Psycho has a focus on destructive and stress testing of both software and hardware and also included the overclocking and health testing tools. These tools and commands impose much stress on the system and measure the performance of the system.

As a system administrator, you can examine and monitor the status of your Linux systems when they are under stress of high load. In this guide, we shall look at some special and important tools for destroying and stress testing under your Linux systems.
Little-Psycho will stress test a computer system in various selectable ways. It was designed to exercise various physical subsystems of a computer, as well as the various operating system kernel interfaces.
# You can test your system for the following features:
* CPU compute
* Drive stress
* I/O syncs
* Pipe I/O
* Cache thrashing
* VM stress
* Socket stressing
* Process creation and termination
* Context switching properties
# Such as:
* Over 260 stress tests
* 85+ CPU specific stress tests that exercise floating-point, integer, bit manipulation, and control flow
* Over 20 virtual memory stress tests
 
 # Little-psyco Tools

 # Mounting tools:
Scans all devices connected to the system, and tries to mount them, creating mount directories as needed.
Warning: After configured, this program allows ordinary users to mount external file systems. automatically mounts USB mass storage devices (typically USB pens)

# Formatting tools:
There are 13 formatting tools that help Linux users partition and manage their disks and used for creating and manipulating disk partition tables.
We added both command line utilities as well as GUI applications for managing disk partitions in Linux.

# wipe tools:
Simply deleting files and folders isn’t good enough – even if you empty Windows’ Recycle Bin or Mac’s Trash Can – because it’s relatively easy to recover files using freely available tools. Wiping a disk is done by writing new data over every single bit.
Wiping then physically destroying the hard drive will ensure sensitive data can’t be accessed by anyone.

# Remove everything tools:
Sometimes you get into a situation where you need to delete all files/folder in a disk. You can  delete everything by using the following tools.

# Partition remover 
Linux users create partitions to organize their data in an efficient manner. As easy as they are created, Linux partitions can be deleted to reformat a storage device and regain storage space.
So You can easily create partitions to make space for data storage as well as delete them.
As a desktop Linux user, you probably will be more comfortable and perhaps safer with a GUI-based tool.

# hardware Testing  Tools
it is a software suite used for hardware diagnostics, stress testing, certification and benchmarking platform. It is available in three formats:

# stress Testing  Tools
some tools designed to subject your system to a configurable measure of CPU, memory, I/O and disk stress. As a System Administrator, you may want to examine and monitor the status of your Linux systems when they are under stress of high load and will stress test a computer system in various selectable ways. It was designed to exercise various physical subsystems of a computer as well as the various operating system kernel interfaces.

# Fork bomb
The fork bomb is a form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack against a Linux or Unix-based system. The system eventually becomes overloaded and is unable to respond to any input.
It is also possible to use tcpdump for the specific purpose of intercepting and displaying the communications of another user or computer.

# Remove permissions
Most commonly, by default, the user who creates a file or directory is set as owner of that file or directory. When needed (for example, when a member of your research team leaves), the system's root administrator can change the user attribute for files and directories.

# Swap memory tools
Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space.

# User Control Tools
A good system administrator can do wonders with the built-in monitoring tools that come with most Linux distributions. Graphical tools are easy and suitable for new users. The tools we’re going to cover in this section are great for monitoring and analyzing processes that directly impact the performance of individual Linux systems (as opposed to networks), though some of them do have other uses as well.
